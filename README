A game made for Ludum Dare 28, with the theme 'you only have one'.  This is a
2-player battle with mines, where each player can throw any number of dummy
mines and only one real one.  However, one player's 'real' mine is a dud, and
neither player knows which.

A player can detonate all of his mines at any time, and can use lasers 3 times
to destroy (without detonating) every placed mine.

The game ends once the real mine has been detonated or destroyed, and the
winner is the player left alive, if any.  If both players are alive, the player
who had the real mine loses.

    DEPENDENCIES

Python (2.6 or later 2.x, 3.2 or later 3.x)
Pygame (1.8.1 or later, probably; tested with 1.9.1)

    RUNNING

To run from source, you must first compile.  This process requires GNU Make or
equivalent or the version of Visual whatever-it's-called that was used to
compile your Python version, and header files for SDL and Pygame must be
available on the system.  Just run

    make

On Windows, this requires the command-line compiler ('cl') to be on your path,
and assumes that SDL.h is in the directory 'sdl_include' above this directory
(horrible, I know).

The makefile supports a 'PYTHON_VERSION' argument which can be 2 (default) or
3, which determines which version to build for.

Now, on systems with a sh-compatible shell, do

    ./run

On other systems (Windows, for example), run run.py with your Python 2
executable.

    CONTROLS

Best played with Xbox 360 controllers (others may also work).

minimise: F10
exit: alt + F4, escape

    with controllers:

move, aim mines: left A-stick
jump: A
throw a dummy mine: X
throw a (potentially) real mine: Y
use lasers: B
detonate all owned mines: RT, RB

    with one controller, player 1:

        scheme 1:

move, jump, aim mines: arrow keys
throw a dummy mine: V
throw a (potentially) real mine: C
use lasers: X
detonate all owned mines: Z

        scheme 2:

move, jump, aim mines: WASD
throw a dummy mine: right shift
throw a (potentially) real mine: right ctrl
use lasers: enter
detonate all owned mines: backspace

    with no controllers:

        player 1:

move, jump, aim mines: arrow keys
throw a dummy mine: right shift
throw a (potentially) real mine: right ctrl
use lasers: enter
detonate all owned mines: backspace

        player 2:

move, jump, aim mines: WASD
throw a dummy mine: space
throw a (potentially) real mine: left shift
use lasers: tab
detonate all owned mines: left ctrl
